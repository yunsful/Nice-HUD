update note (24.10.04) --Sebin Cho
add UI about coin and store system
    -- current coin indicator
        update method TitleScreen.draw line 143
        add entity/Coin
        add method DrawManager.drawCurrentCoin
        add sprite : Coin (updated DrawManager line 82 and 110, res/graphics line 13

    -- buying something(...) UI >> this is for test. wait for store system update. after that, must be changed.
        add players coin getter/setter (but annotated. unwrap it when store option ready)
            add getter to TitleScreen initializer line 47-50
            add setter to TitleScreen.testCoinDiscounter
            update TitleScreen.update line 84-87
            add variable currentCoin in TitleScreen line 23
        update methods TitleScreen.nextMenuItem line 112-113, previousMenuItem line 125
        update method DrawManager.drawMenu line 319-320, 355-362
        add sprite : addSign (update DrawManager line 83 and 111, res/graphics line 14
        add entity/addSign

Ideal process to become
    -- Initializing this Screen gets players Coin saved (line 47 - 50)
    -- when player requests buying option, method coinDiscounter acts,
    -- discount proper amount of coin from current coin( set to 50, currently)
    -- and save outcome to players coin data
    -- and goes on..


To-Do
    -- wait for store option available
    -- this is test version for store option. when the option updated, have to update this version too
    -- but already prepared..
    -- maybe..
