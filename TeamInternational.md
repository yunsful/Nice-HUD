Our area of development is Level Design. Our plan is to implement
procedural level generation that incorporates these features in descending level of priority to
make the game immersive:

<ol>
<li>Adding environment changes depending on level [for example background and/or music change on higher difficulty setting]</li>
<li>Adding a wider variety and/or increased spawnrate of enemy ships</li> 
<li>Adding random obstacles and/or item spawns</li>
<li>Adding boss levels</li>
</ol>

To implement all of these features we also see that there will be
some dependencies on other aspects of the game for example:
Items, Player and Enemy ship variety, Sound Effects BGM, Two
Player mode.
